Redesign of pages of the State Administrative Tribunal of Western Australia website. Responsive and device-friendly

The State Administrative Tribunal of Western Australia tasked me with reconceptualising and redesigning a few of the pages of their live website - their home page, their News & Media Releases page, and one of my choice, for which I chose their Decisions Database page. They required a responsive site that met Government standards, particularly accessibility, and was usable on a variety of mobile devices. This is what I came up with.
